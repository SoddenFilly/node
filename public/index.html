                    <p class='bigtext' style="background-color: transparent;">[gamename] is a procedurally-generated strategy game which pits two players, each playing as the leader of their nation, against each other in a battle of strategy, positioning, and brute strength.  Players are dropped down far away from one another on a randomly-generated world which includes many different biomes and gatherable resources. They must stockpile materials and weapons, recruit AI allies, and build up forts and cities to gain the edge over the other player.  After a grace period, the two players are allowed to attack each other, and the match ends when one of the players is killed. Each player uses their fortifications and armies to eliminate the other player before they get eliminated themselves.</p>

To start playing, simply click or tap the "login" button on the right-hand side of the top navbar (your right, not its).  If you don't already have an account, you can make a new one.  All you need is an email, a username, and a password.  Once you've inputted this information, you'll have an account!</p>
