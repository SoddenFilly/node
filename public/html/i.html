Players are dropped down far away from one another on a randomly-generated world which includes many different biomes and gatherable resources. They must stockpile materials and weapons, recruit AI allies, and build up forts and cities to gain the edge over the other player.  After a grace period, the two players are allowed to attack each other, and the match ends when one of the players is killed. Each player uses their fortifications and armies to eliminate the other player before they get eliminated themselves.</p>
