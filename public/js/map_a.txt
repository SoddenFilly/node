input {
    raw height data matrix
}

process {
    "dissolves/rounds out" the height data matrix.
    generates secondary tile type matrix from previous dissolved data matrix
    nests and returnes both matricies in a parent array [matrix1, matrix2]
}

output {
    an array with two sub-arrays consisting of the height and tile-type data that can be directly printed.
